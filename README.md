# Library Management System

This is a Library Management System developed in C#. It allows users to borrow books and librarians to manage the library's collection.

## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to have a library card so that I can borrow from the library.
2. **As a librarian**, I want to add new books to the library's collection so that they can be available for borrowing.
3. **As a librarian**, I want to display a list of all the books in the library's collection so that users can easily find books they are interested in.
